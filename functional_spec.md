# CLI To Do App
## Introduction
In every workflow it is often necessary to have a way to keep track of tasks. 
In a terminal based workflow, most of the tools already being used are terminal based. 
The purpose of the CLI To Do App it to create a simple way to track tasks without leaving the terminal. 
The user will be able to add, remove, and list tasks.
Tasks are by default undone. The user will be able to mark tasks as done.
## User Story
As a user, I want to add, remove, mark tasks as done and list tasks, so that I can keep track of tasks.
The app is loosely inspired by the Bullet Journal method. Daily tasks are listed simply on a piece of paper as a task, a thought or an event. 
This app will only handle tasks and whether that task is done or not.
## App Commands
To start the app, run `todo`
each task will be numbered in order of when it was added. 
* add - add a task
* remove {number of task} - remove a task
* done {number of task} - mark a task as done
* list - list tasks
* help - show this help message
